    *   Defines functions for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on document metadata in SQLite.
    *   Initializes the SQLite database schema (`crud_init_db`).
    *   Includes `analyze_uploaded_document` to extract initial metadata from files to pre-fill creation forms (distinct from RAG ingestion).
    *   Handles file saving to the `uploads` folder.
*   **`d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\document_processor.py` (RAG Ingestion Processor):**
    *   `UnifiedDocumentProcessor` class is responsible for processing various file types (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, images, text).

    *   Multi-model analysis (Tesseract, Donut, Gemini) for robust metadata extraction from images.
    *   Focuses on extracting structured information like title, description, and dates from image-based documents.
*   **`d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\retrieval\fusion_retriever.py` (Advanced Retrieval):**
    *   Implements `FusionRetriever` which likely uses Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) and query expansion to improve the relevance of documents retrieved for the RAG chain.
*   **Data Stores:**
    *   SQLite (`document_management.db`): Stores structured metadata.
    *   ChromaDB (`chroma_db` directory): Stores vector embeddings of document chunks.
    *   File System (`uploads`, `extracted_text` directories): Stores uploaded raw files and generated Markdown files.

### Data Storage Strategy

*   **Structured Metadata (SQLite):**
    *   Chosen for its simplicity, serverless nature, and ease of integration with Python.
    *   Stores document attributes like title, dates, numbers, department, project, status, file paths, etc.
    *   Suitable for filtering, sorting, and direct display of record information.
*   **Vector Embeddings (ChromaDB):**
    *   Used for efficient semantic search required by the RAG system.
    *   Stores dense vector representations of text chunks.
    *   `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` (768 dimensions) is used for generating embeddings, ensuring consistency.
*   **Raw Files (File System - `uploads` folder):**
    *   Original uploaded documents are stored directly on the file system. Paths are referenced in the SQLite database.
*   **Processed Text (File System - `extracted_text` folder):**
    *   Markdown versions of extracted text and image analyses are saved, potentially for audit, review, or alternative access.

This hybrid approach effectively separates structured queryable metadata from the unstructured content indexed for semantic retrieval.

### AI/ML Integration Strategy

*   **OCR:** A cascading approach is used in `document_processor.py`. Tesseract is tried first. If the quality is low (for images), or if it's a scanned PDF page, it falls back to more advanced models like Gemini Vision for better accuracy. Image pre-processing (enhancement, binarization, deskewing) is applied to improve OCR results.
*   **Embeddings:** `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` with "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2" is used to convert text chunks into vector representations for ChromaDB. This model is chosen for its balance of performance and resource efficiency.
*   **Large Language Models (LLMs):**
    *   **RAG Chatbot:** `ChatGroq` (Llama 4 Maverick) and `DeepSeekLLM` (custom HuggingFace class) are available options for generating answers based on retrieved context. The prompt engineering in `app.py` (`QA_CHAIN_PROMPT`) is crucial for structuring the LLM's output.
    *   **Document Analysis:** Google Gemini (Pro/Flash) is used in `image_analyzer.py` and `document_processor.py` for deeper analysis of image content and for enhancing OCR text.
*   **Retrieval Enhancement:** `FusionRetriever` is employed to improve the quality of documents fed to the LLM by combining results from base retrieval, potentially using techniques like RRF and query expansion.

The architecture allows for flexibility in choosing LLMs and leverages specialized models for specific tasks (e.g., Gemini for vision).

### Security Considerations

*   **Admin Authentication:** A simple password-based authentication (`ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env`) gates access to the admin panel, document processing, and deletion functionalities. This is a basic level of security suitable for internal tools but might need enhancement for broader deployment.
*   **API Key Management:** API keys for Groq, Google Gemini, and HuggingFace are loaded from environment variables (`.env` file), which is a good practice.
*   **File Uploads:** `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename` is used to sanitize filenames, mitigating path traversal risks. `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` restricts file types.
*   **Data at Rest:**
    *   SQLite database and ChromaDB files are stored on the server's file system. File system permissions are the primary protection.
    *   Uploaded documents are also on the file system.
*   **Data in Transit:** If deployed over HTTPS (standard for Streamlit Cloud or custom deployments with a reverse proxy), data between the user and server will be encrypted.
*   **Prompt Injection:** While the RAG system primarily uses internal documents, care should be taken if user input directly forms complex prompts for LLMs, though the current setup seems to use user input mainly as a query.
*   **No User-Specific Data Segregation:** The current system doesn't appear to have multi-tenancy or user-specific document access controls beyond the admin role. All processed documents are accessible via the RAG system to any user who can access the chat interface.

### Scalability and Performance

*   **Streamlit:** Primarily designed for single-user or small-team applications. Scaling to a large number of concurrent users would require deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer or considering alternative frameworks for the frontend/backend.
*   **LLM Inference:** Relies on external APIs (Groq, HuggingFace, Gemini). Scalability here depends on the API providers' rate limits and pricing tiers. Local LLM hosting is not implemented.
*   **Embedding Generation:** Performed locally on CPU. For very large volumes of documents, this could be a bottleneck during initial ingestion. GPU acceleration or a dedicated embedding service could be considered.
*   **ChromaDB:** Performance for similarity search is generally good for millions of vectors, but can degrade with extremely large datasets on limited hardware.
*   **SQLite:** Suitable for metadata of many thousands to a few million records. For very large scale, a more robust RDBMS might be needed.
*   **Document Processing:** Can be resource-intensive, especially OCR and image analysis. Processing large batches of files will take time. Asynchronous processing or a task queue system (e.g., Celery) could be beneficial for large uploads.
*   **Memory Management:** The `memory_track` context manager in `app.py` suggests awareness of memory usage, likely due to loading models or processing large files.

For its intended purpose as an internal records management tool, the current architecture is likely adequate. Significant scaling would require architectural changes.

### Deployment Model

*   The application is built with Streamlit, suggesting it can be deployed using:
    *   Streamlit Cloud (easy deployment for public or authenticated apps).
    *   Self-hosting on a server (e.g., Linux VM, Docker container) running the `streamlit run app.py` command, often behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy for HTTPS and custom domain.
*   Dependencies (Python packages, Tesseract OCR) need to be installed on the deployment environment.
*   Environment variables (API keys, admin password) must be configured.

    *   `TextProcessor`: Utility for formatting text and calculating metrics.
    *   Includes functions for image enhancement to improve OCR quality.
*   **`d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\landing_page.py`:** Defines the Streamlit components for the initial landing page.
*   **`d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\retrieval\fusion_retriever.py`:** Implements `FusionRetriever`, likely using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) and query expansion to enhance document retrieval for the RAG pipeline.
*   **`d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\database.py`:** Appears to be an older or alternative script for database initialization. The main application (`app.py`) uses `crud_init_db` from `CRUD_st.py`.
*   **`d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\crud.py`:** Seems to be another, possibly earlier, version of CRUD functionalities, distinct from `CRUD_st.py` which is integrated into the main app.
*   **`d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\ocr_processor.py`:** A simpler OCR processing class. The more advanced OCR logic resides in `document_processor.py` and `image_analyzer.py`.

**Supporting Files/Directories (Inferred/Created):**
*   `.env`: Stores environment variables (API keys, admin password).
*   `chroma_db/`: Directory for ChromaDB vector store persistence.
*   `uploads/`: Directory for storing uploaded raw document files.
*   `extracted_text/`: Directory for storing Markdown files generated from processed documents.
*   `assets/`: Contains images like logos used in the UI.
*   `.streamlit/config.toml`: Streamlit configuration, including custom CSS.

### Core Logic Walkthroughs

#### Admin Authentication (`app.py`)
1.  Session state `st.session_state.admin_authenticated` (default `False`) tracks login status.
2.  Sidebar displays a password input field.
3.  On "Login" button click, input password compared against `admin_password` (from `.env`).
4.  If match, `admin_authenticated` set to `True`, app reruns to show admin controls.
5.  If not, an error message is shown.
6.  "Logout" button resets `admin_authenticated` to `False`.

#### Document Upload and Initial Analysis (`CRUD_st.py`)
This flow is for pre-filling the "Create Document" form, not for RAG ingestion.
1.  In the "Create" tab of Records Management (`app.py` calls `create_document` from `CRUD_st.py`).
2.  `st.file_uploader` allows admin to upload files.
3.  If files are uploaded, `analyze_uploaded_document(uploaded_files[0])` is called.
    *   This function in `CRUD_st.py` attempts to parse the first uploaded file (PDF, XLSX, DOCX, image).
    *   It extracts text and uses regex and keyword matching to guess `title`, `description`, `doc_number`, `archive_code`, `department`.
    *   Special handling for Excel "COVER" sheets.
4.  The extracted metadata is used to pre-fill the `st.form` fields.
5.  Admin reviews/edits the pre-filled data and submits the form.
6.  On submission:
    *   `save_uploaded_files` saves all uploaded files to the `uploads/` directory.
    *   An SQL `INSERT` statement adds a new record to the `documents` table in SQLite, linking to department, project, and archive code via subqueries on their names/codes. File paths and names are stored as pipe-separated strings.

#### Document Processing for RAG (`app.py`, `document_processor.py`)
1.  Admin uploads files via `st.sidebar.file_uploader` in `app.py`.
2.  If "Process Documents" button is clicked, `process_uploaded_files(uploaded_files)` is called.
3.  `initialize_or_load_vectorstore()` ensures ChromaDB is ready with the correct embedding model.
4.  A `UnifiedDocumentProcessor` instance is created.
5.  For each uploaded file:
    *   If not already processed (checked against `st.session_state.uploaded_file_names`).
    *   `processor.process_document(file)` is called.
        *   `extract_text()`: Determines file type, uses PyMuPDF for PDF, Pillow+Tesseract/Gemini for images, `openpyxl` for XLSX, `python-docx` for DOCX. Involves image enhancement and cascading OCR logic.
        *   Text is split into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
        *   Metadata is prepared (source, file_type, OCR provider, quality score, etc.).
        *   Images from PDFs or image files are analyzed by Gemini, and analyses are appended to the text.
        *   A Markdown file of the content is saved via `_save_markdown`.
        *   `Document` objects (LangChain schema) are created for each chunk with metadata.
        *   `self.vectorstore.add_documents(documents)` adds chunks to ChromaDB.
    *   If successful, file name added to `st.session_state.uploaded_file_names`.
    *   A corresponding record is attempted to be created in SQLite via `create_document_record` from `CRUD_st.py` (this seems to duplicate some metadata storage, but links the RAG-processed content to a structured record).

#### CRUD Operations Implementation (`CRUD_st.py`)
*   **`init_db()`:** Creates SQLite tables (`departments`, `projects`, `archive_codes`, `documents`) if they don't exist and populates them with initial lookup data.
*   **`create_document()`:** (UI and logic) - Described in "Document Upload and Initial Analysis".
*   **`read_documents()`:**
    *   Constructs an SQL query to join `documents` with `departments`, `projects`, and `archive_codes` to get textual names.
    *   Provides Streamlit selectbox filters for department, project, archive code, and status.
    *   Applies filters to the SQL query.
    *   Displays results in a `st.dataframe`.
    *   Offers CSV export.
*   **`update_document()`:**
    *   User selects a document to update from a selectbox.
    *   Fetches the document's current data from SQLite.
    *   Populates a form with existing data.
    *   On submission, executes an SQL `UPDATE` statement.
*   **`delete_document()`:**
    *   Admin-only.
    *   User selects one or more documents via `st.multiselect`.
    *   Requires checkbox confirmation and typing "DELETE".
    *   Iterates through selected documents:
        *   Deletes associated physical files from `uploads/`.
        *   Deletes associated Markdown files from `extracted_text/`.
        *   Executes SQL `DELETE` statement for the record in SQLite.

#### RAG Chain Setup and Execution (`app.py`)
1.  **LLM Initialization:** `get_llm_model` function initializes selected LLM (Groq or DeepSeek).
2.  **Vector Store:** `st.session_state.vectorstore` (ChromaDB) is used.
3.  **Retriever:**
    *   A base retriever is created from `vectorstore.as_retriever()`.
    *   `FusionRetriever` wraps the base retriever, taking the LLM for query expansion.
4.  **Prompt Template (`QA_CHAIN_PROMPT`):** A detailed `ChatPromptTemplate` structures the interaction with the LLM, defining roles (System, Context, Question) and a specific output format (Summary, Details, Specs, References, Notes).
5.  **Document Prompt:** A simple prompt for formatting individual retrieved documents before they are combined.
6.  **LLMChain:** Combines the LLM with the `QA_CHAIN_PROMPT`.
7.  **StuffDocumentsChain:** Chains the `LLMChain` with the `document_prompt`, specifying how to "stuff" the retrieved documents into the context.
8.  **RetrievalQA Chain:** The final chain that combines the `StuffDocumentsChain` with the `FusionRetriever`. `return_source_documents=True` is set.
9.  **Execution:**
    *   User enters a question in the chat UI.
    *   `qa_chain.invoke({'query': prompt1})` is called.
    *   The `FusionRetriever` gets relevant document chunks from ChromaDB.
    *   These chunks are formatted and "stuffed" into the `QA_CHAIN_PROMPT`'s context section.
    *   The LLM generates an answer based on the question and the provided context.
    *   The result (formatted answer) is displayed.

### Database Schema (SQLite)

Managed by `d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\CRUD_st.py` (`init_db` function).

```mermaid
erDiagram
    departments ||--o{ documents : "has"
    projects ||--o{ documents : "has"
    archive_codes ||--o{ documents : "has"

    departments {
        INTEGER id PK
        TEXT name UNIQUE
    }

    projects {
        INTEGER id PK
        TEXT name UNIQUE
    }

    archive_codes {
        INTEGER id PK
        TEXT code UNIQUE
    }

    documents {
        INTEGER id PK
        TEXT title
        TEXT file_title
        TEXT description
        DATE doc_date
        DATE end_date
        TEXT doc_number
        TEXT alt_number
        INTEGER department_id FK "Refers to departments.id"
        INTEGER project_id FK "Refers to projects.id"
        INTEGER archive_code_id FK "Refers to archive_codes.id"
        TEXT security_class
        TEXT status
        TIMESTAMP created_at
        TEXT file_paths "Pipe-separated paths"
        TEXT file_names "Pipe-separated names"
    }
```

**Observations:**
*   Standard relational schema for managing document metadata.
*   Lookup tables (`departments`, `projects`, `archive_codes`) are pre-populated with fixed values.
*   `file_paths` and `file_names` store multiple values as pipe-separated strings, which is a denormalization but simple for this context.

### Key Classes and Functions Deep Dive

#### `UnifiedDocumentProcessor` (`d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\document_processor.py`)
*   **Constructor:** Initializes text splitter, logging, thresholds, Markdown formatter, and Gemini model.
*   **`extract_text(file)`:** Core text extraction logic. Reads file content, routes to specific handlers (`_process_pdf`, `_process_image_with_cascade`) based on MIME type.
*   **`_process_pdf(content)`:** Iterates PDF pages. If a page has little text, it's converted to an image and processed by `_process_image_with_cascade`. Otherwise, uses PyMuPDF's `get_text()`.
*   **`_process_image_with_cascade(image)`:**
    *   Enhances image using `_enhance_image_for_ocr`.
    *   Tries Tesseract OCR.
    *   Assesses Tesseract output quality using `_assess_text_quality`.
    *   If quality is below `self.quality_threshold`, falls back to Gemini Vision for text extraction.
    *   Combines results if both are used via `_combine_ocr_results`.
*   **`_enhance_image_for_ocr(image)`:** Applies OpenCV transformations (grayscale, adaptive thresholding, denoising, contrast adjustment) to improve OCR input.
*   **`_extract_images_from_pdf(pdf_document)`:** Extracts images from PDF and uses Gemini to generate textual analysis for each image.
*   **`process_document(file)`:** Orchestrates the full processing for a single file:
    1.  Extracts text and image analyses.
    2.  Splits text into chunks.
    3.  Prepares metadata (including OCR provider, quality score).
    4.  Saves content to a Markdown file.
    5.  Creates LangChain `Document` objects.
    6.  Adds documents to the `self.vectorstore` (ChromaDB).

#### `EnhancedModelManager` & `DocumentMetadataExtractor` (`d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\image_analyzer.py`)
These classes are primarily used by `CRUD_st.py`'s `analyze_uploaded_document` for pre-filling forms, and parts of their logic (like image enhancement) are also seen in `UnifiedDocumentProcessor`.
*   **`EnhancedModelManager`:**
    *   Manages clients for Groq, Gemini, and HuggingFace Donut model.
    *   `enhance_image()`: Advanced image pre-processing (contrast, sharpness, edge enhancement, adaptive thresholding, deskewing).
    *   `analyze_with_multiple_models()`: Aims to combine Tesseract OCR, Donut model output, and Gemini analysis to extract metadata.
*   **`DocumentMetadataExtractor`:**
    *   Uses `EnhancedModelManager`.
    *   `extract_date_patterns()`, `extract_title_candidates()`: Regex and heuristic-based extraction from OCR text.
    *   `analyze_document()`: Orchestrates image enhancement, OCR, and Gemini calls to populate a metadata dictionary.

#### `FusionRetriever` (`d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\retrieval\fusion_retriever.py`)
*   (Content of this file is not provided, but its role is inferred from `app.py`)
*   Likely implements a custom LangChain `BaseRetriever`.
*   Takes a base retriever (e.g., ChromaDB similarity search) and an LLM.
*   **Query Expansion:** May use the LLM to generate multiple variations of the user's query to broaden the search.
*   **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):** Combines and re-ranks search results from the original query and expanded queries to improve relevance.
*   The `k` parameter controls the final number of documents, and `weight_k` is the RRF constant.

#### LLM Integration (`app.py`)
*   **`DeepSeekLLM` Class:** A custom LangChain `LLM` wrapper for the HuggingFace InferenceClient, specifically for DeepSeek models. Handles API calls and response parsing.
*   **`get_llm_model(model_name)`:** Factory function to instantiate either `ChatGroq` or `DeepSeekLLM` based on user selection.
*   **RAG Chain:** The selected LLM is passed into the `get_rag_chain` function, becoming the core generative component of the `RetrievalQA` chain.

### Environment and Dependencies

*   **Python Version:** Not specified, but likely Python 3.8+.
*   **Key Dependencies (inferred from imports):**
    *   `streamlit`: For the web application framework.
    *   `langchain`, `langchain-groq`, `langchain-chroma`, `langchain-google-genai` (commented out but implies intent), `langchain_community`: For AI/ML orchestration, RAG.
    *   `chromadb`: Vector store.
    *   `sqlite3`: Relational database.
    *   `pysqlite3-binary` (implied by commented-out import shim): Alternative SQLite driver, often for specific environments like Streamlit Cloud.
    *   `google-generativeai`: For Gemini API.
    *   `groq`: For Groq API.
    *   `huggingface_hub`: For HuggingFace InferenceClient (DeepSeek).
    *   `sentence-transformers`: For embeddings.
    *   `fitz` (PyMuPDF): PDF parsing.
    *   `pytesseract`: Tesseract OCR wrapper.
    *   `Pillow` (PIL): Image manipulation.
    *   `opencv-python` (cv2): Image processing.
    *   `python-docx`: DOCX parsing.
    *   `openpyxl`: XLSX parsing.
    *   `werkzeug`: For `secure_filename`.
    *   `python-dotenv`: Loading `.env` files.
    *   `toml`: Parsing `config.toml`.
    *   `stqdm`: Progress bar for Streamlit.
    *   `transformers`: For Donut model in `image_analyzer.py`.
    *   `torch`: Dependency for `transformers`.
*   **External Software:** Tesseract OCR needs to be installed on the system where the app runs. The path is configured in `image_analyzer.py`.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   `.env` file for API keys (`GROQ_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`) and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
    *   `.streamlit/config.toml` for Streamlit app settings like custom CSS.

### Code Quality and Maintainability Observations

*   **Modularity:** The code is reasonably modular, with different functionalities separated into files (e.g., `CRUD_st.py`, `document_processor.py`).
*   **Readability:** Generally good, with comments in places. Function and variable names are mostly descriptive.
*   **Error Handling:** `try-except` blocks are used in many places, especially around file operations, API calls, and database interactions. Logging of errors is common.
*   **Redundancy/Overlap:**
    *   Database initialization logic exists in both `d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\CRUD_st.py` (used by `app.py`) and `d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\database.py` (unused by `app.py`).
    *   CRUD logic seems to have two versions: `d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\CRUD_st.py` (integrated) and `d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\crud.py` (standalone/older).
    *   OCR and image analysis functionalities have some overlap between `d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\document_processor.py` and `d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\image_analyzer.py`. `document_processor.py` seems to be the primary one for RAG ingestion.
*   **Configuration:** Use of `.env` for secrets is good. `config.toml` for Streamlit settings is standard.
*   **Logging:** `logging` module is used, which is good for diagnostics.
*   **Hardcoding:** Some default values (e.g., department, project in `process_uploaded_files` for CRUD record creation) are hardcoded. This might be intentional for a specific workflow or could be made more flexible.
*   **Streamlit Specifics:** Heavy reliance on Streamlit's execution model (e.g., `st.rerun()`, session state).
*   **No Automated Tests:** No evidence of unit tests or integration tests, which would be crucial for maintaining and evolving a system of this complexity.

### Potential Areas for Refactoring or Improvement

1.  **Consolidate Redundant Code:**
    *   Remove or clearly deprecate `d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\database.py` and `d:\p3ri\arsipy-hki\crud.py` if `CRUD_st.py` is the canonical version.
    *   Streamline image analysis and OCR logic. `UnifiedDocumentProcessor` could potentially delegate more to `ImageAnalyzer` components or fully absorb its necessary functionalities to reduce overlap.
2.  **Configuration Management:** Move hardcoded default values (e.g., default department/project for new records) into a configuration file or make them selectable in the UI.
3.  **Database Interaction:**
    *   Consider using an ORM (like SQLAlchemy) for more robust and maintainable database interactions, especially if the schema evolves.
    *   The creation of a CRUD record in `process_uploaded_files` after RAG processing might be better integrated. Ensure data consistency between SQLite and the information used for RAG.
4.  **Asynchronous Processing:** For document ingestion (`process_uploaded_files`), especially with multiple files or large files requiring extensive OCR/AI analysis, consider a background task queue (e.g., Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ) to prevent UI blocking and provide better feedback to the admin.
5.  **State Management in Streamlit:** While session state is used, for more complex interactions, a more structured approach or careful management is needed to avoid unexpected reruns or state conflicts.
6.  **Testing:** Introduce unit tests for core logic (e.g., text extraction, metadata parsing, RAG components) and integration tests for key workflows.
7.  **Class Structure in `CRUD_st.py`:** The functions in `CRUD_st.py` could be organized into a class (e.g., `DocumentManager`) for better encapsulation, especially if it needs to manage database connections or shared state more explicitly.
8.  **Security Enhancements:** For wider use, replace simple password auth with a more robust system (e.g., OAuth, user accounts with roles).
9.  **Code Duplication in `app.py` (Footer):** The footer markdown is repeated in multiple tabs. This could be a utility function.
