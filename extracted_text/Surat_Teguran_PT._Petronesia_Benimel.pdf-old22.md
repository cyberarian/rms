Kepada Yth.
PT. Petronesia Benimel
di-
Tempat

Dengan hormat,

Berdasarkan hasil evaluasi kami terhadap proses pelaksanaan pekerjaan tanah PT. Petronesia Benimel,
maka bersama ini kami sampaikan :

1. Bahwa telah ditemukan area lendutan pada pekerjaan timbunan pada Layer Top Subgrade STA
46+000 – 46+100 LR ( dokumentasi terlampir ),
2. Tanah timbunan pada kedalaman 1 meter dan Top Subgrade masih dalam kondisi basah dan bercampur
dengan tanah disposal yaitu banyak di temukan akar pohon.
3. Ditemukan tanah sejenis dan memiliki karakteristik yang sama pada ketebalan tanah 30 – 45 cm yang
diasumsikan bahwa tanah tersebut tidak dikerjakan sesuai metode kerja yaitu timbunan harus
dikerjakan dengan cara ditimbun per layer dengan ketebalan tanah 20 cm setiap layernya.

Berdasarkan hal tersebut, maka perlu dilakukan perbaikan dengan cara dilakukan penggalian atau
pembongkaran pada area yang mengalami lendutan dan ditimbun kembali sesuai dengan metode kerja
yaitu dengan cara ditimbun per layer dengan ketebalan tanah 20 cm setiap layernya dan dipadatkan.
Demikian surat ini kami sampaikan, atas perhatian dan kerja samanya kami ucapkan terima kasih.

## Document Images Analysis


### Image 1 (Page 1)

**Analysis:**
Here's an analysis of the provided image, formatted for clarity and professionalism:

**1. Description of the Image**

The image is a scan of a formal letterhead document.  It's a letter of reprimand ("Surat Teguran") from PT. Hutama Karya Infrastruktur, a construction company, to PT. Petronesia Benimel, presumably a subcontractor or related party. The letter addresses issues found during the evaluation of soil work performed at a specific project location. It includes details regarding ground conditions, soil composition, and deviations from the specified soil layering method. The letter concludes with a request for corrective actions and a thank you for attention to the matter. The document is signed by the Project Manager, Muhron Nafik, and includes the company logo and official stamps at the bottom.

**2. Technical Details**

*   **Location:** Layer Top Subgrade STA 46+000 - 46+100 LR. This likely refers to a specific station and alignment within the project site.
*   **Soil Depth:**  1 meter (depth of fill material).
*   **Soil Thickness/Layering:** Specified layer thickness of 20 cm for soil compaction.  Existing soil identified in layers of 30-45 cm.

**3. Markings, Labels, and Annotations**

*   **Letter Number:** 0136/HKI-BANGPANG/QC/Ext.038/X/2023. This serves as a reference number for internal record-keeping.
*   **Date:** Bangkinang, 30 Oktober 2023. Indicates when the letter was issued.
*   **Company Logos:** PT. Hutama Karya Infrastruktur.
*   **Signature:** Muhron Nafik, Project Manager.  Authenticates the document.
*   **Project Name:** Proyek Bangkinang - Pangkalan. Identifies the specific construction project.
*   **ANAB/BSI Stamps:** Three seals are present with ANAB (Accreditation National Accreditation Body) and BSI (British Standards Institution) logos, suggesting certifications related to quality management systems. Each has a unique certificate number.
*   **Tembusan:** Lists "Arsip" which indicates where copies of the document are to be filed for record-keeping.

**4. Context/Purpose in Construction Documentation**

This document serves the following purposes within the context of construction documentation:

*   **Quality Control/Assurance:** It documents a deviation from specified construction procedures, related to earthworks and compaction. The QC department is identifying and raising concerns about the soil placement method of the subcontractor.
*   **Communication:** It formally communicates the identified issues to the relevant party (PT. Petronesia Benimel).
*   **Corrective Action Request:** It explicitly requests specific corrective actions to rectify the deficiencies (excavation and replacement of soil layers with proper compaction at 20cm intervals).
*   **Liability and Contractual:** It establishes a formal record of non-compliance, which can be important for resolving contractual disputes or establishing liability should issues arise later (e.g., ground settlement, foundation problems).
*   **Record Keeping:** It provides a documented history of project issues, resolutions, and communications, which is crucial for auditing and future reference.

In summary, the image depicts a letter of reprimand from the main contractor to a subcontractor regarding non-compliant soil work. It's a key piece of project documentation used for quality control, communication, and establishing accountability within the construction process.




### Image 1 (Page 2)

**Analysis:**
Here's an analysis of the provided image, presented in a professional format:

**1. Description of Image Content**

The image is a document page, likely part of a construction or engineering report. It comprises the following elements:

*   **Company Information:** A logo with "HKI INFRASTRUKTUR," the company name "HK TOWER," address, and contact information (phone and fax).
*   **Title:** The word "DOKUMENTASI" is centered at the top of the image.
*   **Photographs:** Four photographs are arranged in a 2x2 grid. These appear to show:
    *   A wide unpaved road under construction, likely a roadbed of compacted soil.
    *   A worker taking a measurement on the roadbed, with a dump truck in the background.
    *   A close-up of the soil profile/cross-section, with a measuring tape for scale.
    *   A close-up of the soil profile/cross-section.
*   **Certification Logos:** Three logos, presumably related to quality or management systems. They include "bsi" and "ANAB" with associated certificate numbers.

**2. Technical Details**

*   **Measurements:** One photograph includes a yellow and black measuring tape. Based on the tape visible in the picture, the soil depth reaches at least 46 centimeters.
*   **Geotechnical Information:** The close-up photographs of the soil profile suggest a visual inspection of soil layers. Color, texture, and possible layer identification are visible in these pictures.
*   **Geographical Information:** The Head Office address indicates the project is happening somewhere near Jakarta, Indonesia.

**3. Markings, Labels, and Annotations**

*   **Logos:** The logos for "bsi" and "ANAB" suggest the company adheres to specific international standards. The certificate numbers are: F8 046526, OHS 045229, and IMS 540520.
*   **"DOKUMENTASI":** The title implies that this page is a part of documentation process.

**4. Context/Purpose in Construction Documentation**

The purpose of this image in construction documentation is likely for:

*   **Progress Monitoring:**  The photographs of the road construction provide visual evidence of the current state of the project.
*   **Quality Control:** The soil profile photographs and accompanying measurements (provided by the measuring tape) are probably part of a soil testing and analysis process to ensure the roadbed meets required specifications.
*   **Compliance:** The certification logos demonstrate that the company follows certain standards and processes, which is important for regulatory compliance.
*   **Record Keeping:** This document serves as a historical record of the construction process and the condition of the site at a particular stage.
*   **Communication:**  This type of documentation facilitates communication between engineers, contractors, clients, and regulatory bodies. The visual data helps to clarify written reports and provides a shared understanding of the project status.

In summary, this document provides a snapshot of a construction project, focused on soil conditions and roadbed construction, within a framework of quality control and regulatory compliance.
