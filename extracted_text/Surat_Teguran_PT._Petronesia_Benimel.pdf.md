Nomor : 0136/HKI-BANGPANG/QC/Ext.038/X/2023
Perihal : Surat Teguran PT. Petronesia Benimel
Lamp :-

Kepada Yth.
PT. Petronesia Benimel
di-
Tempat

Dengan hormat,

Berdasarkan hasil evaluasi kami terhadap proses pelaksanaan pekerjaan tanah PT. Petronesia Benimel,
maka bersama ini kami sampaikan :

1. Bahwa telah ditemukan area lendutan pada pekerjaan timbunan pada Layer Top Subgrade STA
46+000 - 46+100 LR ( dokumentasi terlampir ),
2. Tanah timbunan pada kedalaman 1 meter dan Top Subgrade masih dalam kondisi basah dan bercampur
dengan tanah disposal yaitu banyak di temukan akar pohon.
3. Ditemukan tanah sejenis dan memiliki karakteristik yang sama pada ketebalan tanah 30 – 45 cm yang
diasumsikan bahwa tanah tersebut tidak dikerjakan sesuai metode kerja yaitu timbunan harus
dikerjakan dengan cara ditimbun per layer dengan ketebalan tanah 20 cm setiap layernya.

Berdasarkan hal tersebut, maka perlu dilakukan perbaikan dengan cara dilakukan penggalian atau
pembongkaran pada area yang mengalami lendutan dan ditimbun kembali sesuai dengan metode kerja
yaitu dengan cara ditimbun per layer dengan ketebalan tanah 20 cm setiap layernya dan dipadatkan.
Demikian surat ini kami sampaikan, atas perhatian dan kerja samanya kami ucapkan terima kasih.

## Document Images Analysis


### Image 1 (Page 1)

**Analysis:**
Here's an analysis of the provided document image:

**1. Description of Image Content**

The image is a formal letter, likely part of a construction documentation package. The letterhead indicates it originates from PT. Hutama Karya Infrastruktur, specifically concerning the Bangkinang - Pangkalan project.  The body of the letter addresses PT. Petronesia Benimel. It outlines concerns related to soil conditions and construction practices observed during earthwork operations. The letter concludes with a signature block including the project manager's name and title, and a company seal, followed by copies to archives and quality certification logos.

**2. Technical Details**

*   **Location:** The letter references a specific location: "Layer Top Subgrade STA 46+000 – 46+100 LR". This likely refers to a station (STA) along the project alignment, pinpointing a specific area of the project.
*   **Depth:** The letter mentions fill soil at a depth of "1 meter".
*   **Thickness:** Specific soil layers are noted to be between "30-45 cm" thick. It specifies that embankment work should be done using 20cm layer of soil.

**3. Markings, Labels, and Annotations**

*   **Letterhead:** Includes the company logo (HKI Infrastruktur), company name, address (HK Tower, Jakarta Timur), and contact phone/fax numbers.
*   **Date:** "Bangkinang, 30 Oktober 2023".
*   **Reference Number:** "Nomor: 0136/HKI-BANGPANG/QC/Ext.038/X/2023" - likely a tracking or filing code. The “QC” suggests this is a quality control document.
*   **Subject:** "Perihal: Surat Teguran PT. Petronesia Benimel" - Indicates a warning or notice letter addressed to the specified company.
*   **Recipient:** "Kepada Yth. PT. Petronesia Benimel" - Indicates to whom the letter is addressed
*   **Company Seal:**  A circular seal with the company name and logo.
*   **Signature Block:** "Muhron Nafik, Project Manager" with a handwritten signature.
*   **Distribution List:** "Tembusan: 1. Arsip" - Indicates that a copy of the letter is to be filed.
*   **Quality Certification Logos:** ANAB (ANSI National Accreditation Board) with the BSI (British Standard Institute) logo and certificates. These denote quality assurance or compliance certifications held by the company.

**4. Context/Purpose in Construction Documentation**

The document serves several critical purposes in the context of construction documentation:

*   **Communication:** It's a formal written communication addressed to a specific party (Petronesia Benimel) regarding a construction-related issue.
*   **Problem Identification/Notification:** It documents the identification of problems related to soil conditions, earthwork methodology, and potentially, the quality of work being performed.  Specifically, it highlights issues of subsidence (lendutan), wet/mixed soil conditions, and inappropriate soil layering.
*   **Instruction/Directive:** The letter instructs the recipient to take corrective action. It specifies the need for excavation and re-compaction of affected areas, and the adoption of a different soil layering methodology (20 cm layers).
*   **Quality Control:** The document's presence as a "Surat Teguran" (warning letter) and the inclusion of "QC" in the reference number signifies its role in the project's quality control process.  It's an official record of non-conformance and the required remedial actions.
*   **Legal/Contractual Implications:** As a formal written document, it has potential legal and contractual implications. It establishes a record of communication regarding issues that could impact project quality, schedule, or cost.
*   **Record Keeping:** Copies are sent to the archive for future reference.

In summary, this document is a formal warning letter issued by the project contractor (HKI) to a subcontractor (Petronesia Benimel) concerning substandard earthwork practices. It is an essential component of the project's quality control system and serves as a record of communication, instructions, and potential liabilities.




### Image 1 (Page 2)

**Analysis:**
Here is an analysis of the construction/engineering document image:

**1. Description of Image Content:**

The image is a documentation page featuring four photographs. The upper two photographs depict a construction site, likely a roadbed, characterized by reddish-brown soil. Vehicles, including a truck and possibly a car, are visible, along with personnel on site.  The lower two photographs show close-ups of the soil profile.  One photograph includes a measuring tape for scale. The image also includes the company logo ("HKI Infrastruktur"), contact information for their Head Office, the title "DOKUMENTASI," and logos of three certification bodies (ANAB).

**2. Technical Details:**

*   **Measurements:** One of the soil profile close-ups includes a measuring tape. The tape reads values in centimeters. The soil cut seems to reach about 46-47cm in height.
*   **Location:** The company's head office is located in Jakarta Timur-13340.
*   **Contact:** The phone number is (021) 8193708, and the fax number is (021) 8196107.

**3. Markings, Labels, and Annotations:**

*   **Title:** The page is titled "DOKUMENTASI" (Indonesian for "Documentation").
*   **Company Logo:** The "HKI Infrastruktur" logo is present.
*   **Certification Logos:** Three "ANAB" logos appear at the bottom, next to each is a certification number.

**4. Context and Purpose:**

The image serves as documentation within a construction or engineering project. It most likely captures the following:

*   **Site Condition:** The upper images are likely intended to document the existing site conditions of the roadbed prior to, during, or after a specific phase of construction. This is important for record-keeping, progress tracking, and potential claims management.
*   **Soil Profile:** The close-up soil profile photos are likely part of a geotechnical investigation or material testing process. The measurement tape is used to show the thickness of different soil layers, essential for determining soil properties and load-bearing capacity. This could be used to confirm compliance with design specifications, or to adjust construction methods based on the specific soil conditions encountered.
*   **Overall Progress:** The combination of images likely portrays the overall progress of a road construction project, including earthworks and material characteristics.
*   **Certification:** The presence of the certification logos (ANAB) indicates that the organization adheres to specific standards and is committed to quality control and assurance.

In summary, this image provides visual documentation of site conditions, soil profiles, and potentially construction progress for a road infrastructure project. It includes information required for internal review, stakeholder reporting, and quality assurance.
